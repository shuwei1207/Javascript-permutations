input: integers n, r (m, k; or m, n) where 0<=r<=n (0<=k<=m-1; or 1<=n<=m, respectively ) 

output: 
(1) results of P(n, r), C(n, r), n^r, C(r+n-1, r) with respect to n, r;  
(2) the first n Catalan, triangular, harmonic,  Fibonacci, Lucas with respect to n;
(3) Eulerian numbers with respect to m, k for 0<=k<=m-1 (i.e., a_sub(m,0), a_sub(m,1), ... , a_sub(m,m-1) ) and
(4) Stirling number of the second kind with respect to m, n for 1<=n<=m (i.e., S_sub(m,1), S_sub(m,2), ... , a_sub(m,m) )
